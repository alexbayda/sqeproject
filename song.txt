Lace your heart with mine
Let your sleeping soul take flight
Take me through the night
Down down down by the river
Down down down by the river
 
Hanging moon in fog
Mists will lead where you belong
Sweep me off my feet
Down down down by the river
Down down down by the river
Down down down by the river
