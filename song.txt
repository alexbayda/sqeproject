Lace your heart with mine
Let your sleeping soul take flight
Take me through the night
Down down down by the river
Down down down by the river
 
Hanging moon in fog
Mists will lead where you belong
Sweep me off my feet
Down down down by the river
Down down down by the river
Down down down by the river

Inky embers
Swirl and dance
Just leap the flames to take a chance
To be with me tonight
Take my hand
And hold it tight
'Cause you and I are everywhere
The night is young
We're going down down down by the river
Down down down by the river
Down down down by the river

Don't wake me up
Just leave me there dreaming
